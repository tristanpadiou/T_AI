    "# Updated MCP Handling in Pydantic AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Changes Made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Changes**: Added proper MCP imports to `t_agent.py`:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHTTP, MCPServerSSE, MCPServerStdio\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent Creation**: MCP servers are now passed as `toolsets` parameter:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   server = MCPServerStreamableHTTP('http://localhost:8000/mcp')  \n",
    "   agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[server])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Manager Support**: Each MCP server instance is a toolset and can be used with async context managers:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   async with agent:  \n",
    "       result = await agent.run('How many days between 2000-01-01 and 2025-03-18?')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Connection Management**: Updated the TAgent class to properly handle multiple MCP server connections and disconnections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits:\n",
    "- More efficient connection management\n",
    "- Proper resource cleanup\n",
    "- Support for multiple MCP servers\n",
    "- Automatic connection handling when using context managers\n"
